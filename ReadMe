## Download

You can find the latest versions for the respective Zabbix releases on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/saumyajit/zabbix_module_create_hostgroups_as_admin_users.git).

## Requirements

- Zabbix 6.0 & Above
- File write access to the Zabbix frontend server

## Installation

For Debian and Ubuntu server, the Zabbix Frontend modules are usually placed in ``/usr/share/zabbix/modules/``.

Copy the folder `modules/admin-hostgroups` to `/usr/share/zabbix/modules/admin-hostgroups` on the Zabbix frontend web server.

Then go to `Administration`, `General`, `Modules`, click `Scan directory` and enable the new module in the list.

## Usage

Once the frontend module is activated, a new menu entry `Create admin host group` should appear for Zabbix admins under `Configuration`.

The host group form is similar to the one for super admins, except it is limited to sub-groups to groups where the admin user has write permissions.
