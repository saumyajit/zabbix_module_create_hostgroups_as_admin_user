Zabbix Admin HostGroups

Zabbix Admin HostGroups is a Zabbix frontend module that allows Zabbix Admin users to create host groups within the scope of their existing write-accessible host groups.
This extends the default Zabbix functionality, enabling admins (not just super admins) to better organize and manage hosts within their permitted domains.

⚙️ Requirements

Zabbix 6.0 or later

Write access to the Zabbix frontend server file system

🧩 Installation

For Debian and Ubuntu systems, Zabbix frontend modules are typically located in:

/usr/share/zabbix/modules/


Copy the folder modules/admin-hostgroups to:

/usr/share/zabbix/modules/admin-hostgroups


on your Zabbix frontend web server.

In the Zabbix web interface, navigate to:
Administration → General → Modules

Click Scan directory.

Enable the newly detected module Admin HostGroups.

🚀 Usage

Once activated, a new menu entry “Create Host Groups (Admin)” will appear under:
Data collections (visible to Zabbix Admin users).

The creation form closely resembles the default host group creation form used by Super Admins,
but it is restricted to creating subgroups only under host groups where the current admin user has read/write permissions.

💡 Example Use Case

A Zabbix Admin responsible for a specific environment (e.g., Production or Development) can now create additional nested host groups within that environment — without requiring Super Admin privileges.
